//! Compare a target transcript against the codex (reference) transcript.
//!
//! Three layers of comparison:
//!  - Schema: every frame must round-trip through the typed `codex-proto`
//!    structs (delegated to [`crate::schema`]).
//!  - Method-presence: methods that succeed on codex must succeed on the

//!  - Notification pattern: for each step, the *kinds* of notifications
//!    emitted by the target must match codex's (modulo allowlist), and
//!    where both emit a given kind, their key-fingerprints must match.
